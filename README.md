# Wireless Motion Detector

###### Copyright Â© 2024 Elijah Day

### About

In short, the Wireless Motion Detector is a device made to observe motion at a
mount point, from which it may wirelessly report any motion to a server or
other device.

The main board uses Espressif Systems's ESP32-C3 for its MCU, largely due to its
Wi-Fi connectivity and thorough documentation.  Motion detection is done through
the use of an infrared LED and receiver pair.  (This means that the detection
has a somewhat short range.)

Development on this project was started without a clear application in mind.  It
was moreso done as an exercise in PCB and firmware design rather than a way to
solve any particular problem.  Though, you may be able to find some utility in
this project if you look hard enough.

One example might be security (monitoring opening of entry points, like doors or
windows).  The device could be configured to send a message to a server upon
sensing motion at an entry point.  After reception of a message from the device,
a server could be set to send a message to a user alerting them of the entry.
